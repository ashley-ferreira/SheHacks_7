The reason they gave was that the audit committee needed time to gather all opinions before making a decision. The want to make sure they have everyone's opinion. This is similar to how decisions might work on a school project together. Students class may need extra time to get things done right so they can present it well when it's due. Another example, if students is only one student who wants something then they he or she needs to think harder about what others think as they not there his or her idea may never happen because Sometimes we all have good ideas but sometimes our best efforts don't seem worth much without other people involved hard too! otherwise maybe maybe there isn't enough time left over after trying through everything else… -so just waiting until next year would help us out since than rushing ahead now even though nothing bad happened yet? It seems likely though some leaders being just need a little bit longer than others...I wonder why sometimes times are different?
