Recalling its resolutions 53/203 A of 18 December 1998, 54/189 A of

welcoming recent calls by the Security Council, the United Nations Special Mission
to Afghanistan, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

unique Buddhist sculptures in Bamiyan, would be an irreparable loss for humanity
as a whole,

to protect the cultural heritage of Afghanistan from all acts of vandalism, damage
and theft;

2. Strongly urges the Taliban to review their edict of 26 February 2001 and

further destruction of the irreplaceable relics, monuments or artefacts of the cultural
heritage of Afghanistan;

When two countries have a problem they can't solve, they take it to the United Nations. If they don't like each other they may start fighting. The United Nations is also called the UN. When there is a fight they try to help people that are in danger. Sometimes they send police to stop the fighting. They also send food and water so nobody will starve or die of thirst. When they do this they call it a mission. But sometimes they need a special group of police officers who can arrest someone even if that person is from another country. This group is called the International Tribunal for Rwanda. It has judges from many different countries.''

The people who started war in Angola are bad because they hurt people there and forced people to leave their homes. The United Nations is going to help people in Angola get things back together again so they can go home and.
This would be an excellent way for young students to learn about UN resolutions and how they have helped change our world!
Kids may not understand everything at first but they will begin to grasp the concepts over time if we teach them early enough that there is more than one way to resolve problems. Even adults don't always do this well – let's start with our kids!! It's never too early or late in life – just keep talking!!! :) Good We'll get somewhere someday!

UN Security Council decided to let goods get into Iraq again starting July 4th 2001 because Saddam would allow better control over money earned from oil sales this time. The USA did not like that idea but France, Russia and China supported it so they won. By 2002 many countries had stopped helping enforce the sanctions because they thought Saddam was going to stop selling oil anyway so why bother. They were wrong. This made enforcement very hard.
