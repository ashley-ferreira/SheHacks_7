Recognizing the large-scale relief and humanitarian assistance efforts being

Government of Bolivia to build peace and democracy and achieve a favourable
environment for promoting economic growth and furthering human development,

Aware of the grave consequences of natural disasters, which may present a
serious obstacle to economic and social development in the developing countries,
and which require considerable amounts of human and financial resources to
overcome their negative effects, and considering it essential that the international
community offer all its technical and financial support and assistance in order to

rehabilitation, reconstruction and development in the areas afflicted by these natural

55/243. The destruction of relics and monuments in Afghanistan

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 53/203 A of 18 December 1998, 54/189 A of
17 December 1999 and 55/174 A of 19 December 2000,

Bearing in mind the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights1 and the need to respect the common heritage of humankind,

Respecting the multicultural, multi-ethnic and historical heritage of
Afghanistan,

Deeply concerned and appalled by the Taliban edict of 26 February 2001,
ordering the destruction of all statues and non-Islamic shrines in Afghanistan, and
by the deliberate ongoing destruction of these relics and monuments which belong
to the common heritage of humankind,

Recalling the several appeals made by the General Assembly to all Afghan
parties to protect the cultural and historic relics and monuments in Afghanistan, and
welcoming recent calls by the Security Council, the United Nations Special Mission
to Afghanistan, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and
others, urging the Taliban to halt their destruction,

Noting that the destruction of the statues in Afghanistan, in particular of the
unique Buddhist sculptures in Bamiyan, would be an irreparable loss for humanity
as a whole,

1. Strongly calls upon the Taliban to abide by their previous commitments
to protect the cultural heritage of Afghanistan from all acts of vandalism, damage
and theft;

2. Strongly urges the Taliban to review their edict of 26 February 2001 and
to stop its implementation;

3. Also strongly urges the Taliban to take immediate action to prevent the
further destruction of the irreplaceable relics, monuments or artefacts of the cultural
heritage of Afghanistan;
