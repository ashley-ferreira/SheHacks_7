 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 55/285 of 7 September 2001, entitled “Revitalization 
of the General Assembly; improving the efficiency of the General Assembly”, 

 Convinced that a smooth transition between successive presidencies of the

could usefully contribute to improving the work of the Assembly, 

 1. Decides, for the purpose of the present resolution only, to waive the 
procedure set out in rule 163 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, by 
which a committee would report on the amendments set out below;

follows: 

 (a) The present rule 30 shall be replaced by the following text: 

 “Elections 

“Rule 30 

 “Unless the General Assembly decides otherwise, the General 
Assembly shall elect a President and twenty-one Vice-Presidents at least 
three months before the opening of the session over which they are to 
preside. The President and the Vice-Presidents so elected will assume 
their functions only at the beginning of the session for which they are 
elected and shall hold office until the close of that session. The Vice-
Presidents shall be elected after the election of the Chairmen of the six 
Main Committees referred to in rule 98, in such a way as to ensure the 
representative character of the General Committee”; 

 (b) The present rule 31 shall be replaced by the following text: 

“Temporary President 

“Rule 31 

 “If, at the opening of a session of the General Assembly, the 
President for that session has not yet been elected, in accordance with 



A/RES/56/509 
 

2 

rule 30 above, the President of the previous session, or the chairman of 
that delegation from which the President of the previous session was 
elected, shall preside until the Assembly has elected a President”; 

 (c) Paragraph (a) of the present rule 99 shall be replaced by the following 
text: 

 “All the Main Committees shall, at least three months before the 
opening of the session, elect a Chairman. Elections of the other officers 
provided for in rule 103 shall be held at the latest by the end of the first 
week of the session”; 

 3. Decides further that, for the fifty-seventh session of the General 
Assembly only, the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Chairmen of the Main 
Committees shall be elected as early as possible; 

 4. Decides that these amendments will enter into force on 8 July 2002.

defenders,  

 Noting further with deep concern that, in a number of countries in all regions 
of the world, impunity for threats, attacks and acts of intimidation against human 
rights defenders persists and that this has a negative impact on the work and safety 
of human rights defenders,

organizations and groups play in the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, including in combating impunity,
