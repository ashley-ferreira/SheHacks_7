SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1340 (2001) [ON THE NOMINATIONS FOR PERMANENT JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA]
Everyone will vote on these judges to help make a court where people will be sent who broke the rules and committed crimes against humanity during Balkan war. Some of these people are going to go to jail if they get caught committing a crime against humanity in that war. It was a horrible time when there were lots of bad things happening so we need to send these people off so no more bad things happen again. These men and women will do their best to judge these people properly because if they don't do a good job then maybe someone innocent could end up being punished while a real criminal walks free because it wasn't judged right. Also, some countries don't like each other very much but they are can still work together to help create a fair court with the power to stop criminals from doing bad things again.
