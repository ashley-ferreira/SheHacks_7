Recalling its resolutions 53/203 A of 18 December 1998, 54/189 A of

to Afghanistan, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

unique Buddhist sculptures in Bamiyan, would be an irreparable loss for humanity
as a whole,

to protect the cultural heritage of Afghanistan from all acts of vandalism, damage
and theft;

2. Strongly urges the Taliban to review their edict of 26 February 2001 and

further destruction of the irreplaceable relics, monuments or artefacts of the cultural
heritage of Afghanistan;

When two countries have a problem they can't solve, they take it to the United Nations. If they don't like each other they may start fighting. The United Nations is also called the UN. When there is a fight they try to help people that are in danger. Sometimes they send police to stop the fighting. They also send food and water so nobody will starve or die of thirst. When they do this they call it a mission. But sometimes they need a special group of police officers who can arrest someone even if that person is from another country. This group is called the International Tribunal for Rwanda. It has judges from many different countries.''

The people who started war in Angola are bad because they hurt people there and forced people to leave their homes. The United Nations is going to help people in Angola get things back together again so they can go home and.
This would be an excellent way for young students to learn about UN resolutions and how they have helped change our world!
Kids may not understand everything at first but they will begin to grasp the concepts over time if we teach them early enough that there is more than one way to resolve problems. Even adults don't always do this well – let's start with our kids!! It's never too early or late in life – just keep talking!!! :) Good We'll get somewhere someday!

UN Security Council decided to let goods get into Iraq again starting July 4th 2001 because Saddam would allow better control over money earned from oil sales this time. The USA did not like that idea but France, Russia and China supported it so they won. By 2002 many countries had stopped helping enforce the sanctions because they thought Saddam was going to stop selling oil anyway so why bother. They were wrong. This made enforcement very hard. Meanwhile read entire passage if you want more details.

The general assembly decided to delay a decision about giving more power to the audit committee of the UN. They will wait until next year to decide. The reason they gave was that the audit committee needed time to gather all opinions before making a decision. The want to make sure they have everyone's opinion. This is similar to how decisions might work on a school project together. Students class may need extra time to get things done right so they can present it well when it's due. Another example, if students is only one student who wants something then they he or she needs to think harder about what others think as they not there his or her idea may never happen because Sometimes we all have good ideas but sometimes our best efforts don't seem worth much without other people involved hard too! otherwise maybe maybe there isn't enough time left over after trying through everything else… -so just waiting until next year would help us out since than rushing ahead now even though nothing bad happened yet? It seems likely though some leaders being just need a little bit longer than others...I wonder why sometimes times are different? Hmmm.. let me know what you think about these questions please!! :) ~Tia~

When a nation is divided into pieces, many nations work together to help make it whole again. That was true when the Philippines became free from Spanish rule. It happened when South Africa freed itself from apartheid. Now that Israel and Palestine are trying to work out their differences, we need to be patient and give them time to become a strong country again. The United Nations decided to send a former President of Ghana to help these countries get along better. His name is Kofi Annan. He will go to Israel and Palestine and try to keep everyone happy. The United Nations thought that he did such a good job as the head of the United Nations that they want him to continue working with them.

America

The General Assembly,

Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

acts of terrorism, and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or

accountable.

1st plenary meeting
12 September 2001



I think this resolution is important because it makes sure there are no more
attacks on US soil like 9/11/2001 again. It also wants to catch the terrorists who did it.
Also it wants to punish the countries who support or help them and their causes.
Finally, it asks other countries to work together to make the world safer from
terrorism.

Israel is bad because they took over the land where Jesus was born and killed people and now we want them to give it back but they wont.
Second grader brief one paragraph summary of UNGA resolution text above:
There means if you are Jewish, Muslim or Christian you have religious freedom even Israel wants us to believe whatever religion we want and live wherever we want in! You don't have to believe what your government says. They can't tell us what religion we have to believe in. But there's still fighting going on there right I hope everyone will get along soon and be friends forever

OBSERVER STATUS FOR THE COMMUNITY OF SAHELO-SAHARAN STATES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY : RESOLUTION / ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

 United Nations A/RES/56/92 

 

General Assembly Distr.: General 25 January 2002 

Fifty-sixth session 
Agenda item 173 

 

01 47945 

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly 

[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/56/598 and Corr.1)] 

  56/92. Observer status for the Community of Sahelo-Saharan 
States in the General Assembly 

 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Considering the importance of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, an 
intergovernmental organization that addresses the common interests of its members 
and takes account of the diverse links that unite their peoples, and given the 
determination of the organization to confront the factors that have caused economic 
backwardness and instability in its member States, its conviction that joint action in 
a framework of complementarity is the best way to integrate its countries and 
peoples, its commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security in 
the Sahelo-Saharan region and its determination to satisfy the wish for economic, 
cultural, political and social integration in accordance with the Charter of the United 
Nations, the Charter of the Organization of African Unity, the Charter of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Treaty Establishing the African 
Economic Community of 3 June 1991 (the Abuja Treaty)1 and the constitutive 
documents of the regional organizations to which its member States belong, 

 Considering also the need, frequently noted by the United Nations, to promote 
and support every effort towards the development of bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation on the basis of international law, 

 Noting that the treaty establishing the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States 
stresses regional cooperation as part of the process of achieving African unity on the 
basis of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotion of social justice 
and stability, 

 Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and the 
Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, 

 1. Decides to invite the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States to participate 
in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer;

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary action to implement 
the present resolution. 

 

85th plenary meeting 
12 December 2001 




This UNGA resolution gives observer status to a group of African nations called the Community of Sahelian States in the UN General Assembly. This means they can now watch all UN meetings but not vote or debate like other countries who are full members. To do this, it asks the Secretary-General to invite them to attend UN meetings. It also requests that he make sure they get all information about the UN so they know how it works. It does this because it believes the UN will benefit from working with these African states since they share many goals. These include promoting regional cooperation, economic growth and stability. It passed unanimously by a roll call vote. No votes against or abstentions were recorded. All 193 Member States voted yes.

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 55/150 of 12 December 2000, wherein it was decided 
to establish an Ad Hoc Committee on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their 
Property, open also to participation by States members of the specialized agencies, 
to further the work done, consolidate areas of agreement and resolve outstanding 
issues with a view to elaborating a generally acceptable instrument based on the 
draft articles on jurisdictional immunities of States and their property adopted by the 
International Law Commission at its forty-third session,1 and also on the discussions 
of the open-ended working group of the Sixth Committee and their results,2 

 1. Decides that the Ad Hoc Committee on Jurisdictional Immunities of 
States and Their Property shall meet from 4 to 15 February 2002; 

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to make available to the Ad Hoc 
Committee the comments submitted by States in accordance with General Assembly 
resolution 49/61 of 9 December 1994 and on the reports of the open-ended working 
group of the Sixth Committee established under Assembly resolutions 53/98 of 
8 December 1998 and 54/101 of 9 December 1999;2 

 3. Requests the Ad Hoc Committee to report to the General Assembly at its 
fifty-seventh session on the outcome of its work;

The GA voted to send the draft convention for states to consider if they want to be bound by it as a treaty when ratified. If so many of the privileges and immunities contained in the ILC Articles will become binding international law for all countries that join the treaty, except as modified by any specific reservations or declarations they may make upon ratification. That's why this effort is called the "universalization" of the ILC Articles - because they would apply universally once a treaty is entered into force through those who joined.
In my opinion, there are five elements in to reaching this milestone in international law and they are listed here:
#Universalization is have enough supporters states that it can be considered a real world benchmark standard; #ILC articles are # must be retained largely framework
##UN member states##mustgovernmental organizations##non-governmental organizations

Decisions are made by voting, this means that all countries get to vote. This
means that everyone's voice is heard. I like this. The United Nations makes a lot of decisions about how to help children around the world. Everyone would you believe they meet what we should eat too? ( no way! They decide't even care about us, but they do care a lot about our rights. That's nice. If you were not sure what your rights are go look them up! It will tell you all about what your rights are. And remember your rights with your own voice! use your words to make sure people respect you! You can talk so can start. write everybody out if something doesn't seem fair to you. People have to listen to you because it is your right! Don UN even protect than that... you can ask the United Nations to help protect you if your rights are not being protected. Even they help too when they are no parents. If you want your country could help other countries in need you can talk that. They might just help you seriously. Sometimes make to hear you can ask a letter or e go someone who works helps called. Make ever I know? Because I did reading you, and people trust me me. and at
