All parties had until October 5, 1995, to implement all aspects of the agreement. The UN then adopted several resolutions about the implementation of the peace agreement, which was called the Dayton Accords. If it did not work out, the UN could take steps under Chapter VII. One resolution was that the International Tribunal for War Crimes was created to But if a party or parties violated the peace agreement or threatened war, they would be condemned by the UNSC. Another resolution said that NATO troops would have to stay until a permanent security force replaced them. Finally, the UN asked all member states to contribute financially and militarily as needed to ensure peace in Bosnia.\n",

In 1999 a special group was created called the Administrative Tribunal and it decided that the terms of all five members should be extended. That is why in 2000 they had to extend one more time. So they created this new plan that would have no abuse of power. This plan gives the South African a 2 year extension and then the others are appointed for 6 years at different times so there is no way any member can be abusive to his position or use that position to influence other positions on the board.\n",

      " The United Nations is divided into two groups of members. The group with permanent seats on the Security Council are called P-5, while the other nations are known as elected or non-permanent members. The five countries with permanent seats are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They all have veto power on the council, which means they can reject any decision made by the rest of the body. Most decisions require nine out of fifteen votes for adoption, so the P-5 only need to convince four other members to join them in voting no. The ten non-permanent members are selected for two-year terms by regional blocs. In the Western European and Others Group, three countries are chosen at once. In 2021, Germany, Indonesia, and South Africa were elected. Every year, two more non-permanent members are chosen from Latin America and the Caribbean, African States, and Eastern Europe. From 2022 to 2023, these will be Brazil, Gabon, and Ghana. There is also one seat each for Asia, Oceania, and Arab States. The President of the Council rotates monthly among the member states. Currently, India holds the position.\n",

The United States wanted this action taken after they discovered there was a terrorist group operating in the area, al-Qaeda. Resolution 1367 did not allow for the use of ground troops but gave NATO permission to bomb military bases and other sites controlled by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's government. Resolution 1367 also called for an end to sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia after Milosevic refused to cooperate with demands from the West. After almost three weeks of NATO bombing, Milosevic agreed to withdraw all forces from Kosovo. It is believed that over 20,000 people died during the war in Kosovo. Many human rights groups said it was actually genocide since most of the dead were civilians caught up in ethnic violence between Albanians and Serbs.

I think that this is really fair because other countries like North Korea and Iran don't care about other countries' laws and are very dangerous. If we didn't make this rule then more countries might try and get a nuclear weapon, which would make our country weaker because we wouldn't be able to stop them from using them against us.
