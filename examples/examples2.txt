ASSISTANCE TO BOLIVIA AS A RESULT OF THE FLOODING EXPERIENCED IN RECENT MONTHS : RESOLUTION / ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
This resolution is about a big storm in Bolivia that happened last year. The
Bolivian people need help to rebuild their country. The U.N. asked for money and
other aid to help them get back on their feet. The U.N. wants to prevent
political instability, so they are going to give help. The U.N. will send money
to rebuild bridges, roads, and water supply systems. They will also provide
hospitals with medicine and doctors to care for people who were hurt in the
storm. This was my first time trying out our "Passion for Rights" project. I
didn't know how much I was going to like writing a speech and making it into a
slide show. I hope to get more do it again next year! Thank you Ms. Mar for
our room mom, you helped us SOO much! We love you!!!

SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1340 (2001) [ON THE NOMINATIONS FOR PERMANENT JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA]
This is a United Nations Security Council Resolution that says that all member states have agreed to nominate these 11 judges to the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). It then says that they are forwarding those nominations to the UN General Assembly.
5th grader explanation of this UN resolution text above: This UNSC resolution is saying that it has nominated 11 people to be judges on the ICTY. It was made after the UNSC asked for nominations from member states and then agreed on these 11 nominees. This resolution was adopted unanimously by all 15 members of the UNSC. The main reasons it was adopted were because the UNSC is trying to make progress on implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement, which set up the ICTY; and because there is no agreement yet on how long the ICTY will exist so this resolution continues to fill positions on the ICTY as they open up until an agreement can be reached on its lifespan. The resolution was forwarded to the UNGA because it was discussed and approved without a vote.
6th grader summary of this UN resolution text above: This is a UNSC resolution about how it selected 11 new judges for the ICTY, which was created as part of the Dayton Peace Agreement after ended the Bosnian War. The

SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1347 (2001) [ON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LIST OF CANDIDATES NOMINATED FOR JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA]
This United Nations resolution was a follow-up to Resolution 1329. It recommended 6 names to fill 6 vacancies of judges in the International Tribunal for Rwanda. One judge had been elected already from Madagascar. So, this resolution recommended 5 other names, but only 4 of the names were accepted by the General Assembly in Resolution A/56/869 of 10 April 2002. The fifth name could not be elected because his country Benin did not submit his nomination papers.

REVIEW OF THE QUESTION OF THE TERM OF OFFICE OF THE BOARD OF AUDITORS : RESOLUTION / ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Resolution 55/248 is a decision to make some changes in how the UN auditor works. It does this by changing two things. First, it changes the terms of office so the auditor serves for 6 years instead of 5. Second, it changes who is allowed to serve more than one term in the office. The result is that the current auditor may serve an extra year, but he cannot be re-elected.

SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1351 (2001) [ON RENEWAL OF THE MANDATE OF THE UN DISENGAGEMENT OBSERVER FORCE (UNDOF)]

Two countries fight a war with each other.  A large group of people are killed.  To make sure that more people do not die, a large peacekeeping army is put in place to make sure that the two sides don't fight any more.  The peacekeepers are given a list of rules called "ceasefire".  If they see that the rules are broken, they can get involved to stop the fighting.  However, even though the ceasefire is supposed to be working, it has been broken over and over again, and thousands of people have died because of it.  In order to try to get the two sides to agree to a permanent peace, the United Nations has passed a new law telling both sides to stop fighting and try to make peace with each other.  This law will last for six months, but if the two sides are unable to make peace within that time, the peacekeepers may have to continue to stay there longer.  It also says that if they cannot't figure out how to make peace, then the whole conflict will go back to being decided by an arbitrator.
