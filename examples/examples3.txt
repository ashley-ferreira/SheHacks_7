00 57373

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[without reference to a Main Committee (A/55/L.79 and Add.1)]

55/243. The destruction of relics and monuments in Afghanistan

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 53/203 A of 18 December 1998, 54/189 A of
17 December 1999 and 55/174 A of 19 December 2000,

Bearing in mind the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights1 and the need to respect the common heritage of humankind,

Respecting the multicultural, multi-ethnic and historical heritage of
Afghanistan,

Deeply concerned and appalled by the Taliban edict of 26 February 2001,
ordering the destruction of all statues and non-Islamic shrines in Afghanistan, and
by the deliberate ongoing destruction of these relics and monuments which belong
to the common heritage of humankind,

Recalling the several appeals made by the General Assembly to all Afghan
parties to protect the cultural and historic relics and monuments in Afghanistan, and
welcoming recent calls by the Security Council, the United Nations Special Mission
to Afghanistan, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and
others, urging the Taliban to halt their destruction,

Noting that the destruction of the statues in Afghanistan, in particular of the
unique Buddhist sculptures in Bamiyan, would be an irreparable loss for humanity
as a whole,

1. Strongly calls upon the Taliban to abide by their previous commitments
to protect the cultural heritage of Afghanistan from all acts of vandalism, damage
and theft;

2. Strongly urges the Taliban to review their edict of 26 February 2001 and
to stop its implementation;

3. Also strongly urges the Taliban to take immediate action to prevent the
further destruction of the irreplaceable relics, monuments or artefacts of the cultural
heritage of Afghanistan;

                                                          
1 See resolution 2200 A  (XXI), annex.

4. Calls upon Member States to help, through appropriate technical
measures, to safeguard the sculptures, including, if necessary, their temporary
relocation or removal from public view.

94th plenary meeting
9 March 2001



In February 2001, the Taliban of Afghanistan issued an edict ordering the destruction of statues and non-Islamic shrines in Afghanistan. This is really bad because those are part of our common human heritage. Now the United Nations wants all countries to do whatever they can to try to preserve the cultural relics.

This United Nations resolution requested that the General Assembly "considers" or look over the nominations of 18 people who are nominated as ad litem judges on the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. This resolution was passed on April 27, 2001 with 15 votes in favor and 0 against. People voted for this resolution because they wanted a quick decision on these nominees so that the tribunal could continue working on cases that are still going through the court system and also continue new cases as well without being held up by a lack of ad litem judges on the tribunal itself.
 important idea is that if there are not enough judges then the entire tribunal cannot work properly until more judges are found to replace any missing ones, so having enough judges is very important for the workings of a international tribunal such after something armed conflict has ended like what happened with the former Yugoslavia region 1991 and 1999 when 
 addition it is good that all the judges members have a been re-elected but just that there are some empty seats where we need to vote for people to fill those positions too which is why we needed this resolution to move forward so quickly as possible before things get held up even more than they already have been since it started back in 1991 now until today when everything finally settled down again thanks got peace

The UN agreed to give food, supplies, money, and medical help to citizens in Iraq. This would last until Saddam Hussein gives back land to Kuwait and pays war reparations to them. They hope this helps get rid of him so they don't have to send any more aid.
