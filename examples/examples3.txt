SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1348 (2001) [ON EXTENSION OF THE MANDATE OF THE UN MONITORING MECHANISM ON ANGOLA SANCTIONS ESTABLISHED BY SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1295 (2000)]
UNSC Resolution 1348 allowed Angola's president to stay in power if he promised to allow free elections before his term ended in December 2002. The same resolution had earlier made sure UN observers would monitor the elections for fairness. Angola's president won the election. On 21 June 2003, UNSC Resolution 1440 extended the authority of UNITA rebels until 31 July 2003 so that they could leave their bases and join the national army or return to their home areas peacefully. This UNSC action ended the Angolan Civil War which had begun in 1975 when the government was overthrown. In 2006, two estimated 400,000 people had died because of war in Angola.

SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1352 (2001) [ON MEASURES TO PROVIDE FOR THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE]
A draft resolution was submitted by US President George W Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2001. The Security Council extended the embargo on Iraq for another 30 days and intended to develop an improved regime that would allow greater civilian supplies into Iraq. This would not affect the sanctions against military supplies to Saddam Hussein's regime. They also decided to extend the oil-for-food program for another six months while they continued negotiations about the new regime. At this point, it was unclear how much authority these nations had in regards to UN much power Iraq would have over the goods. Also no progress was made in reducing the sanctions against Iraq. This resolution shows some lack of clarity regarding international law enforcement due but the borders. It does show intent throughout least progress try to reduce peace among two countries.

CREDENTIALS OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE 25TH SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY : RESOLUTION / ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
Here are two paragraphs from our UN Resolution text. The first paragraph says the General Assembly is going to vote on who gets to be there. The second paragraph says it has already decided to let these people be there. So the assembly will vote on something that has already been decided. That seems like a waste of time. But we need a record of how everyone voted so that no one can change their vote after the fact. Also, sometimes governments say they want to go back home for a few days and don't come back. The General Assembly wants to to come back.
