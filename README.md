# SheHacks-7
**January 15-17, 2023 @WesternU**
The first actual hackathon I've gone to. Mostly just enjoying the events and meeting new people but also playing around with the Cohere API for the first time. 

Some interesting ideas I am thinking about:
- Putting UN resolutions into normal person speak (but only a summary, allow for multilingual?)
- Semantic search of UN resolutions (using embeddings, and also plotting these?)
- Extracting country votes from UN transcripts (even making a table?)
- Extracting stances of countries on issues from UN transcripts, summarizing these and doing clustering using embeddings?

Questions:
- What is the token limit?
- Are there other summarization things to use like TLDR?
- Way to get this UN data with an API?
